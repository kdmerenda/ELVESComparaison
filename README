Configuration for FD reconstruction of simulated events.  While the reconstruction configuration for real 
events uses the databases for FD calibration constants and Atmospheric conditions, this configuration 
uses fixed calibration constants for each pixel and uses parametric models for description of the atmosphere.
No databases are accessed when using this configuration.

Please consult the doxygen-generated documentation for details on how to inspect the configuration files
used for this application.
